## My Current Project:
Currently, I am working on 2 projects in my spare time:
```
One is a differentiation/integratation program that can be used to figure out areas under graph lines.
I wrote it in JavaScript and have been practically testing by figuring out the area underneath bridges near my house.
My second Project is a game built in UE5 (Unreal Engine 5) that is written in c++.
It's all very new to me but I've been finding it extremely fun to learn.
