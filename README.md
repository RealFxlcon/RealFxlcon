# Fxlcon's Github Page! 
Welcome to my Github Page! Here you can find out:

1. What I'm currently working on.
2. Some information about me.
3. What my plans for future projects are.

## My Current Project:
At the moment, I am working on 2 projects in my spare time:

One is a differentiation/integration program that can be used to figure out areas under graph lines. I wrote it in JavaScript and have been practically testing by figuring out the area underneath bridges near my house.

My second Project is a game built in UE5 (Unreal Engine 5) that is written in c++. It's all very new to me but I've been finding it extremely fun to learn.

## General Information:
1. I'm 20 years old.
2. Right now I'm working as a Python software development student with CoGrammar.
3. I studied Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science in college but decided not to go to university.
4. My favourite language to code in has to be JavaScript, but I also like Python, Java and C#

## What my Plans for Future Projects are:
Obviously I want to finish my studies and then go on to get a full time job in the software development industry. However, as far as future projects, I want to finish the game I've been working on and see what people think of it when it's finished. I think I also want to experiment with physics simulations because I've always found them very interesting and a really nice challenge.

### Some Fun Facts:
1. I love video games and spend a lot of my free time playing them.
2. I also really enjoy getting active and going to the gym.
3. If I could live in one country it would have to be Cyprus.
4. My favourite video game of all time is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege
